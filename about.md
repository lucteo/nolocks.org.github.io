This site is a manifesto for not using locks and raw threads for building concurrent programs.

One can find here articles, videos and other materials about why this is a bad thing.

The site is, obviously, not complete. If you know more good resources, please contribute. Pull requests or direct-messages to [@LucT30](https://twitter.com/LucT3o).

But, the best way to contribute is to spread the word.
