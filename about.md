This site is a manifesto for not using locks and raw threads for building concurrent programs.

One can find here articles, videos and other materials about why this is a bad thing.

The site is, obviously, not complete. If you know more good resources, please contribute. You can create [issues](https://github.com/nolocks-org/nolocks-org.github.io/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/nolocks-org/nolocks-org.github.io/pulls).

But, the best way to contribute is to spread the word.
